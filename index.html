              looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
              amazing experience here. I signed up for the tree intro course and
              found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
              12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
              completing the course, l've successfully switched careers. working
              as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. â€¢</small

              needed some structure from p professionals who can help me learn
              programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
              student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
              rogram. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
              were very hands-on and I never had to wait long tor assistance.
              The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
              learning to the next level ina way that no tutorial could ever
              have. In fact. I've often referred to it during interviews as an
              example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
              job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 00%
              recommend! "</small
